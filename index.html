            <p id="pin">As the end term is approaching we have to buckle up to tackle it as it might be difficult
                as compared to the
                rest of the quizzes and assignments we gave so i made this quizz site to help you all out with the most
                probable questions for the end term..</p>

                <span id="tubs">I have Uploaded only Permutations and combinations RN.. if i see people solving here
                    i'll add
                    quiz of
                    all the other lessons taught..</span>

                <ul>
                    <li>The questions will keep getting difficult over time.(only if u can slve the easier ones)</li>
                    <li>There are no fixed questions.. you can solve as much as you want and will get the result
                        according to no. of correctly solved/no of solved</li>
                    <li>Click on "Finish" and you'll get the marks in percentage and Remarks</li>
                    <li>You can skip a question if you find it tough (you're recommended to take an SS of that to solve
                        it later)</li>
                    <li>I could have added your rank comparing with others but it's not of any use to
                        compete..
                        just
                        practise and
                        leave</li>
                    <li>The question in there are most probable to be asked in the End term math, only changing numbers
                        will do..</li>
                    <li>Suggestion.. i've made this site just as a test.. so do not go for the UI and all i didn't give
                        much time to it</li>
                    <li>Click on the option directly the answer will be submitted..</li>
